Atos OPTICA Code Exercise 1
We require a simple HTTP based RESTful API that provides 3 operations for managing customers. These Operations are:
• Operation 1: Add a Customer
• Operation 2: Remove a Customer, given their ID
• Operation 3: List all Customers
Where a Customer has the following attributes:
1) Id
2) Firstname
3) Surname

The API 
and its Operations should:
Use JSON for data transfer
Adhere to REST principles
Be written using Java
Be committed to a publicly available SCM
Be runnable/testable on a Windows or Mac laptop with JDK 8 and Maven 3 installed (e.g. via maven commands or similar)
Have automated tests for each operation
There is no need to persist the data (i.e. no need to use a database)
This exercise should take no more than 2.5 hours, assuming your development machine is already configured with Java, and IDE etc. You may use whichever Framework/3rd Party Libraries you wish, as long as they’re publicly available from the central Maven Repository.
